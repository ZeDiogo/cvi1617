1.Vessel Detection ---> 2.Spatial Constraints ---> 3.Time Consistency

VD
- Obtain a tentaive set of blocks that may be vessels.
- Estimate sky & reflectio blobs using spatial constraints.
- Finally time consistency, using multiple frames

1) - Thresholding operation
2) - SPATIAL validation: aim at obtaining blobs = (centri,raioi,areai) i=1....n
            Areai > THs ----> select areas greater than the vessel area
            Blobi doesn't touch the sky(image boudnary) ---> select sky blobs
            Blobi is not isolated --->eliminate reflections
            
3)Time Consistency- 
     - Many of the obtained blobs are located randomly
